# UnixShell

In order to compile the source code, you need to follow the following steps:

    1. Type in your terminal 'make compile', without the quotes.
    2. Execute the program by typing ./main.out
    
There you go. You can now use the UNIX shell.

NOTE: this program uses UNIX systems calls, therefore it's just compile in UNIX-based systems.
